# Car-Price-Prediction-using-Regression-RFE-VIF

In this repository, built a model (using Linear Regression, RFE, VIF) to predict price of cars with the available independent variables.
Following are the steps followed to build a model:

Below are the steps which we will be basically following:

Step 1: Reading and Understanding the Data

Step 2: Cleaning the Data
Missing Value check
Data type check
Duplicate check

Step 3: Data Visualization
Boxplot
Pairplot

Step 4: Data Preparation
Dummy Variable

Step 5: Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets
Rescaling

Step 6: Building a Linear Model
RFE
VIF

Step 7: Making Predictions Using the Final Model

Step 8: Model Evaluation
